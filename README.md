TASK 1:  API testing via Postman and automating via Python
Flickerâ€™s API documentation is https://www.flickr.com/services/api/ . Please read it carefully, signup for a free flicker account to get your own authentication key. You have to understand, call and use these one/two Flickr APIs (preferably using Postman as that is a de-facto software for API calling).

https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.blogs.postPhoto.html (OPTIONAL, extra bonus points - requires Oauth authentication too)
